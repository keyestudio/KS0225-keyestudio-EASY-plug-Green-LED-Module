## 1. Introduction

This is a special EASY plug green LED module. When connecting to ARDUINO, after programming, it can emit green light.

For easy use, the module’s 3pin are brought out as a crystal head socket. The socket is compatible with EASY plug Control board V2.0. You should connect the LED module to control board for communication using an RJ11 cable.

You can combine with other sensors to do various interactive experiments. You can also choose other LED modules to emit different light color like blue, red, yellow and white.

**Special Note:**

The sensor/module is equipped with the RJ11 6P6C interface, compatible with our keyestudio EASY plug Control Board with RJ11 6P6C interface.

If you have the control board of other brands, it is also equipped with the RJ11 6P6C interface but has different internal line sequence, can’t be used compatibly with our sensor/module.
